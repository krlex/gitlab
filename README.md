# Gitlab for self hosting

![](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/wm.svg)

We strongly recommend choosing the official Linux package installation since it is quicker to install,
easier to upgrade, and it contains features to enhance reliability not found in other methods.
We also strongly recommend at least `4GB` of RAM and CPU `2` to run GitLab.

```
./install.sh gitlab.example.com
```
or
